# Planet project - planning document

## Goal
The climate last about 1 million years has been largely determined but the change of the eccentricity (elongation) of Earth’s orbit (One of the Milankovitch cycles. The glacial cycles (daily speaking: ice ages) with a period of about 100 000 years are thought to be due to this. Theory: The gravity form the other planets, especially Jupiter, causes the change of the eccentricity

*Problem: Reproduce Milankovitch cycle of eccentricity (100ka)*

**Method**: Use Python

Let’s go for functional programming

**Input**: Some initial positions of the planets but no external data

Perhaps also user input of length of simulation

**Output**: Graph of orbits and a timeseries of an eccentricity parameter

**Development steps**

*Earth-sun system*

*Add Jupiter*

*Make modular*

*Add more planets?*

## Design
- Define constants 
- Define initial values positions velocity (balance of gravity and centrifugal force 
- (Allocate (book) space for long vectors plan iteration) 
- Iteration 
- Change of positions 
- Calc acc (gravity) 
- Calc new velocity 
- Plot resulting ellipses 
- Calculate orbit parameters 
- Plot time series of parameter change

## Overview

```plantuml

@startuml

start

:define some parameters;
:initialize earth (and Jupiter);

repeat
  :calculate acceleration;
  :calculate velocity in two dimensions;

repeat while (simulation time is met) is (no)
->yes;
:figure plotting;
